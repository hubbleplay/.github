## 🌧️ In case of the worst...

In case of **Hubble** being blocked, we have come up with a quit simple solution.
We made an external site, **[h-current.github.io](https://h-current.github.io)**, to house the crutial information of what the new link is. Now it will take up to a day for the link to be upated but don't worry, it won't be long.
